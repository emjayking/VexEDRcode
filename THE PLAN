THE PLAN:
 alrighty guys listen up,
 the plan is simple.... win

 so here's what I need:
 Everyone - figure out how to use github, I want to use this for sharing all our
  files and code
 Sean - I need to know what software you want me to put on this laptop for you
    or I can give the laptop to you and you can do it yourself
 Jack - I need to know if there's anything you want on here for 3d design or
  modeling/engineering etc
  James - I Want you to finally finish your paper work to an acceptable degree

THE PLAN PART TWO:
  we need a full list of what we want mr swallow to buy for us

  we also need to write a letter about the robotics program to go into the schools
  yearly book thingy (make it good so we get mo money)

  and we need to up our game, last saturday was a wakeup call, everyone had improved
  drastically and im hoping that we can too.

p.s. do you think we should add recoe to the github plans. also i need to know
if anyone is keen on going to the remaining competitions this year and if
any1 wants to work on the robot over the holidays.
