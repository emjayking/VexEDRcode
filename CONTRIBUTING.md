### WELCOME ###
This will help you with making meaning full additions to this repository

The basics:
- make sure to spell and grammar check your work.
- name your work at the bottom of the page, it can be a pain to figure out who wrote what otherwise.
- avoid profanity wherever possible (this is a public page and Git Hub has strict compliancy stuff n things)

When making a plan:
label the document with '_plan' at the end (I will also make a plans folder for this as well)
ensure it is ordered and logical and make sure that links to any extra information are provided
please label if it is for the vex EDR or IQ or for the team etc
please clearly state what and who the plan will involve so people don't waste their time


footnote: James, these are mainly for you, we need actually detailed paperwork.
